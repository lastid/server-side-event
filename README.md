# Realtime data from server using server side event

Simple test of server side event using nodejs.  
Make sure you have a decent node version (tested with 6.14.3 & 9.11.1).

How to run:
- Clone the repo
- Inside the project run 
```
npm install 
npm run start
```
- Open http://localhost:8080 in Chome. Change the port number in server.js if needed.
